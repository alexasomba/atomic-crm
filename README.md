## Installation and local development

To run this project locally, you will need the following tools installed on your computer:

- Make
- Node 22 LTS
- Docker (optional; only needed for unrelated local tooling)

Fork the [`marmelab/atomic-crm`](https://github.com/marmelab/atomic-crm) repository to your user/organization, then clone it locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[username]/atomic-crm.git
```

Install dependencies with Vite+:

```sh
cd atomic-crm
make install
```

This will install the dependencies for the frontend and the backend, for the Cloudflare Worker and local D1.

Start the Cloudflare-backed app locally:

```sh
make start
```

This starts the Vite frontend and Cloudflare Worker against local D1.

You can then access the app via [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/). You will be prompted to create the first user.

For the demo provider, use `vp run dev:demo`. To run the Cloudflare-native frontend, Worker, and MCP server together, use `vp run dev:all` or `vp run dev:cloudflare`. Cloudflare D1 and Better Auth are the only application backend; FakeRest is available for demos.

If you need debug the backend, you can access the following services:

- Cloudflare Worker: [http://localhost:8787/](http://localhost:8787/)
- REST API: [http://127.0.0.1:54321](http://127.0.0.1:54321)
- Local R2 attachments are managed by Wrangler's local Worker runtime.
- Local inbound email uses the Worker `email()` handler; staging routes
  `crm@atomic-crm.asomba.com` through Cloudflare Email Routing.

## CopilotKit assistant

The in-app CopilotKit assistant uses the Cloudflare Worker runtime in staging and
production, with the Node runtime retained only for local rollback and MCP
development:

- `atomic-crm-app` — the static frontend (this repo)
- `atomic-crm-copilot` — the local/rollback CopilotKit runtime (Hono server in `server/`)
- `atomic-crm-mcp` — the MCP contract analyzer (also in `server/mcp/`)

The chat UI uses shadcn Base UI primitives for message rows, bubbles, streaming markers, anchored transcript scrolling, attachments, and guided Copilot briefs.

Copilot tools talk to the same authenticated CRM APIs as the rest of the app
(D1 on Cloudflare, FakeRest in demo). `VITE_COPILOTKIT_API_URL` is optional and
is not needed in Cloudflare mode.

- `VITE_COPILOTKIT_RUNTIME_URL` — optional alternate CopilotKit endpoint. Leave unset to use the same-origin Worker route, `/api/copilotkit`.

### Local dev workflows

The default local stack is the Vite frontend plus the Cloudflare Worker:

```sh
pnpm run d1:migrate:local
vp run dev:cloudflare
```

Configure `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` in `.dev.vars` before signing in. CopilotKit
runs natively on the Worker; MCP is optional:

```sh
vp run dev:all
```

The in-browser FakeRest demo (no Worker) is:

```sh
vp run dev:demo
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` to the Worker at
`http://localhost:8787` (override with `COPILOTKIT_PROXY_TARGET`). Use
`COPILOTKIT_RUNTIME_MODE=proxy` and `make start-server` only for the Node
rollback runtime.

### Cloudflare Worker workflow

The staged Cloudflare runtime can be started with:

```sh
vp run dev:cloudflare
```

This runs the Vite frontend and Wrangler Worker together. Cloudflare D1 and
Better Auth are selected automatically. Configure `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` in
`.dev.vars` before using authentication. Apply local
D1 migrations with `pnpm run d1:migrate:local`.
The staging Worker serves CopilotKit natively through the TanStack AI
CopilotKit factory and its `AI` binding. Set `CLOUDFLARE_AI_MODEL` if you need a
different Workers AI model; no account ID or AI API token is required. Use
`COPILOTKIT_RUNTIME_MODE=proxy` only for the local Node rollback path.
Build the staging frontend with `vp run build:staging`; this selects the
Cloudflare data/auth providers and same-origin Worker API before deployment.

### Staging acceptance

Set `STAGING_TEST_EMAIL` and `STAGING_TEST_PASSWORD` locally, then run:

```sh
pnpm run smoke:staging
pnpm run sso:register:staging
```

The authenticated smoke test creates and removes a contact, note, task, and
attachment. For inbound email, send from a CRM sales-user address to a CRM
contact while CC'ing `crm@atomic-crm.asomba.com`; the Worker associates the
sender with the sales user and a To/Cc/Bcc recipient with the contact.

### Router

TanStack Router is the canonical application and test router. Set
`VITE_ROUTER=tanstack` for an explicit local smoke test; `vp run build:staging`
enables it automatically. URLs, query strings, resource routes, and ra-core
data fetching remain unchanged.

`react-router` and `react-router-dom` remain direct compatibility dependencies
because the current `ra-core` release statically imports its React Router
adapter even when a custom router provider is configured. The CRM has no
application or test imports of React Router. Those compatibility packages can
be removed after upgrading to an `ra-core` release that no longer requires that
adapter.

## Documentation

The user and developer documentation for this project is available [in the `doc/` directory](./doc/). You can also read it online at [https://marmelab.com/atomic-crm/doc/](https://marmelab.com/atomic-crm/doc/).

## Testing and builds

This project contains Vitest unit and browser tests. Run them with the following command:

```sh
vp test
```

Use `vp check` for formatting, linting, and typechecking, `make typecheck` to skip formatting/linting, and `vp build` for a production build. You can add tests anywhere in `src`; use `*.test.tsx` or `*.test.ts`.

## Vite+ build diagnostics

The root project uses Vite+ 0.2.8 for installation, checking, testing, development, and production builds. Production sourcemaps remain enabled. Current builds report large application chunks because the CRM resource definitions are eagerly registered by the admin shell; the measured main application chunk is approximately 2.7 MB minified (812 kB gzip). This warning is retained so future route-level splitting is driven by a measured payload improvement rather than hidden with a higher warning limit.

Tailwind CSS and Vite CSS post-processing may report `SOURCEMAP_BROKEN` warnings because those upstream transforms do not emit sourcemaps. These warnings are documented here and are not suppressed by disabling production sourcemaps.

## Registry

Atomic CRM components are published as a Shadcn Registry file:

- The `registry.json` file is automatically generated by the `scripts/generate-registry.mjs` script as a pre-commit hook.
- The `http://marmelab.com/atomic-crm/r/atomic-crm.json` file is automatically published by the CI/CD pipeline

> [!WARNING]  
> If the `registry.json` misses some changes you made, you MUST update the `scripts/generate-registry.mjs` to include those changes.
